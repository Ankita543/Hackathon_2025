### Local Lens — Smarter Travel with Context

### Bringing Weather, Recommendations, and Routes Together for Every Traveler

---

## Overview

**Local Lens** is an intelligent travel companion feature designed to enhance the Vrbo travel planning experience.

When a traveler searches for a destination, Local Lens automatically curates:

* Real-time weather updates for the selected travel dates
* Smart, personalized itineraries based on location and traveler interests
* An interactive map connecting all key destinations and activities

This feature transforms a simple accommodation search into a complete travel discovery journey — blending inspiration, context, and logistics in one unified experience.

## Why We Built It

Most travelers plan their trips using multiple tools — one for accommodation, another for weather, and others for itinerary planning or mapping.
Local Lens simplifies this process by bringing everything together within the Vrbo experience, helping travelers make more informed and confident decisions.

> Don’t just find a stay — find your journey.
